# postgresql_exporter

A Prometheus exporter for some postgresql metrics.

## Getting Started

You can add as many database connections as you like to the
`config.yml` file, and run it with:

```console
./postgresql_exporter -config=my/config.yml
```

Then you can add hostname:9111 to the prometheus scrapes config:

```yml
- job_name: 'postgresql'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9111']
```

And voil√°, metrics should be there and you should be able to query,
graph and alert on them.

## Configure PostgreSQL
You need enable the pg_stat_statements extension on postgresql.conf, adding this on end of the file:

```sh
# Extension pg_stat_statements
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.max = 10000
pg_stat_statements.track = all
```

Before that, restart the PostgreSQL service.

## PostgreSQL 10

### Setting up a restricted monitoring user

By default some stat views like pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_activity doesn't allow viewing queries run by other users, unless you are a database superuser. Since you probably don't want monitoring to run as a superuser, you can setup a separate monitoring user like this:

Create the monitoring role:
```sql
CREATE ROLE monitoring WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword'
  CONNECTION LIMIT 5 IN ROLE pg_monitor;
ALTER ROLE monitoring SET search_path = monitoring, pg_catalog, public;
```
Create the monitoring database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE monitoring OWNER monitoring;
```
Connect on monitoring database and create the function pgstattuple.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pgstattuple(IN relname text,
    OUT table_len BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_count BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_len BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_percent FLOAT8,
    OUT dead_tuple_count BIGINT,
    OUT dead_tuple_len BIGINT,
    OUT dead_tuple_percent FLOAT8,
    OUT free_space BIGINT,
    OUT free_percent FLOAT8) AS $$
  SELECT
    table_len,
    tuple_count,
    tuple_len,
    tuple_percent,
    dead_tuple_count,
    dead_tuple_len,
    dead_tuple_percent,
    free_space,
    free_percent
  FROM public.pgstattuple(relname)
$$ LANGUAGE SQL VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;
```

The process executed above is necessary one time per cluster. Now we can configure each database that will be monitored.

Connect on database that you need export the metrics and execute:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgstattuple;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {{database_name}} TO monitoring;
```

Note that these statements must be run as a superuser (to create the SECURITY DEFINER function), but from here onwards you can use the `monitoring` user instead. The exporter will automatically use the helper methods if they exist in the `monitoring` schema, otherwise data will be fetched directly.

## PostgreSQL 9.6 or lower

The default role `pg_monitor` was only added in PostgreSQL 10 (See more details [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/default-roles.html)). If you're running Postgres 9.6 or lower you need to create some other helper methods in the `monitoring` schema:

Create the monitoring role:

```sql
CREATE ROLE monitoring WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword';
ALTER ROLE monitoring SET search_path = monitoring, pg_catalog, public;
```

Connect on database that you need export the metrics and execute:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgstattuple;

CREATE SCHEMA monitoring;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION monitoring.pgstattuple(IN relname text,
    OUT table_len BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_count BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_len BIGINT,
    OUT tuple_percent FLOAT8,
    OUT dead_tuple_count BIGINT,
    OUT dead_tuple_len BIGINT,
    OUT dead_tuple_percent FLOAT8,
    OUT free_space BIGINT,
    OUT free_percent FLOAT8) AS $$
  SELECT
    table_len,
    tuple_count,
    tuple_len,
    tuple_percent,
    dead_tuple_count,
    dead_tuple_len,
    dead_tuple_percent,
    free_space,
    free_percent
  FROM public.pgstattuple(relname)
$$ LANGUAGE SQL VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION monitoring.pg_stat_activity() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_activity AS $$
  SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity;
$$ LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE VIEW monitoring.pg_stat_activity AS
  SELECT * FROM monitoring.pg_stat_activity();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION monitoring.pg_stat_statements() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_statements AS $$
  SELECT * FROM public.pg_stat_statements;
$$ LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE VIEW monitoring.pg_stat_statements AS
  SELECT * FROM monitoring.pg_stat_statements();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION monitoring.pg_stat_replication() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_replication AS $$
  SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_replication;
$$ LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE VIEW monitoring.pg_stat_replication AS
  SELECT * FROM monitoring.pg_stat_replication();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION monitoring.pg_stat_progress_vacuum() RETURNS SETOF pg_stat_progress_vacuum AS $$
  SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
$$ LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE VIEW monitoring.pg_stat_progress_vacuum AS
  SELECT * FROM monitoring.pg_stat_progress_vacuum();

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {{database_name}} TO monitoring;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA monitoring TO monitoring;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA monitoring TO monitoring;
GRANT SELECT ON monitoring.pg_stat_activity TO monitoring;
GRANT SELECT ON monitoring.pg_stat_statements TO monitoring;
GRANT SELECT ON monitoring.pg_stat_progress_vacuum TO monitoring;
GRANT SELECT ON monitoring.pg_stat_replication TO monitoring;
```

## Running it within Docker

```console
docker run -p 9111 -v /path/to/my/config.yml:/config.yml caninjas/postgresql_exporter
```
